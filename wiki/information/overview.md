# Overview

`core` is the shared foundation repository for **MCAgents**. It is intended to
hold the agent and API code that MCAgents' Minecraft plugins and mods build on, so
that behavior common to several projects lives in one place instead of being
copied between them.

## Current state

The repository is at the setup stage. It contains **no source code yet**. What
exists today is:

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Project overview and quick start. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Entry point for agents: reading order, routing, standing conventions. |
| `INDEX.md` | Root router pointing at every index in the repository. |
| `LICENSE` | MIT license, `Copyright (c) 2026 MCAgents`. |
| `.agents/` | The agent instruction set — rules, git conventions, planning, platform knowledge, prompts, creators. |
| `wiki/` | This documentation tree. |

There is no language, package manager, build system, test runner, entry point, or
CI pipeline in the repository at this point. Documentation describing any of those
will be written when they actually land — see
[`environments/setup.md`](../environments/setup.md).

## How the repository is organized

The project separates three kinds of content, and keeps them strictly apart:

* **Instructions** — rules an agent follows — live under `.agents/`, one topic per
  file, at `.agents/{folder}/{file}.md`.
* **Documentation** — pages a human reads — live under `wiki/`, at
  `wiki/{folder}/{file-name}.md`. This page is one of them.
* **Overviews** — `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` — stay short and point elsewhere.
  Detail is never left in them; it is moved down into `wiki/`.

Navigation runs through a tree of `INDEX.md` files: the root `INDEX.md` lists the
indexes, each index lists what its own scope contains. The point is that an agent
can find the one file it needs by reading a few small tables, rather than loading
the whole repository. Start at [`INDEX.md`](../../INDEX.md).

## Change logs

Released versions are recorded under `wiki/logs/{Major}/{Minor}/{Patch}/`. No
version has been declared yet, so no version directory exists. See
[`../logs/INDEX.md`](../logs/INDEX.md).
