# Wiki Index

**Scope:** `wiki/`
**Parent:** [root-index](../INDEX.md)

This index owns `wiki/` and only `wiki/`. It must never write into `.agents/`.
Any page added to or removed from `wiki/` is reflected here **in the same commit**.

## Information

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`information/overview.md`](information/overview.md) | What this repository is, what it is for, and what it contains today. |

## Environments

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`environments/setup.md`](environments/setup.md) | Getting a local working copy, and what tooling does and does not exist yet. |

## Child Indexes

| Index | Scope | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| [`logs/INDEX.md`](logs/INDEX.md) | Versioned change logs under `wiki/logs/` | You need release history, or must record a change against a version. |
