# Wiki Index

**Scope:** `wiki/`
**Parent:** [root-index](../INDEX.md)

Any page added to or removed from `wiki/` is reflected here **in the same commit**.

| [`information/overview.md`](information/overview.md) | What this repository is, what it is for, and what it contains today. |
| [`information/modules.md`](information/modules.md) | The ten build modules, how they depend on each other, and what is published. |

## Environments

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`environments/setup.md`](environments/setup.md) | Getting a local working copy, and building, testing, and publishing it. |

## Child Indexes
