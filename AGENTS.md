# AGENTS

`MCAgents/core` holds the shared agent and API code that MCAgents' Minecraft plugins
and mods build on: a Gradle multi project on Java 25, whose `api` and `common`
modules carry the language model API and whose `platforms/*` modules cover the three
Bukkit servers and the two mod loaders. See
[`wiki/information/overview.md`](wiki/information/overview.md).

This file is an **entry point and an activation contract**. It contains no rules of
its own; it tells you which rules apply and where they are.

## Shared Instruction Set

The conventions this repository follows — branching, commits, pull requests, task
workflow, the creators — live in the shared instruction set served by the
**`lxagents-agents-base`** MCP server. This repository carries only what is its
own. **Resolve the shared set before doing any work:**

1. If the `lxagents-agents-base` connector is available in this session, that is
   the shared set. Refer to it as `{shared}`; its files are addressed as
   `agents://{folder}/{file}.md`.
2. Read `agents://manifest.json` once. It lists every shared file with its `name`,
   path and description — one read instead of twenty, and it is what the routing
   tables below are checked against.
3. Read `agents://index/root-index.md` and route from there. Do not bulk-read the
   set.
4. If the connector is not available, say so plainly and continue with this
   repository's local instruction set only. **Do not reconstruct the missing rules
   from memory, and do not clone or copy them into this repository.**

Never commit shared content into this repository. A file that can be read from
`agents://` must not exist here as a copy — see
`{shared}/rules/duplicate-instruction-audit.md`.

**Local overrides shared.** A file in `.agents/` whose `name` matches a shared
file's `name` replaces that shared file entirely for this repository. The current
overrides are listed in
[`.agents/index/root-index.md`](.agents/index/root-index.md).

## Auto-Activation

The instruction set is **always active** — the local `.agents/` set and the shared set
together. It applies to every task in this repository whether or not the user mentions
it, links to it, or asks for it. Treat these files as standing orders, not as optional
reference material.

At the start of every session, before doing any work:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (this file).
2. Resolve the shared set per the bootstrap above.
3. Read [`.agents/index/root-index.md`](.agents/index/root-index.md).
4. Read [`.agents/index/memory-index.md`](.agents/index/memory-index.md) and load only
   the memory rows whose scope matches the current request, so you continue prior work
   instead of restarting it.
5. Match the request against the trigger table below and load the instruction files it
   names, local first, shared second.

If a rule conflicts with a habit, a default, or a template you would otherwise follow,
the rule wins. If it conflicts with an explicit instruction from the user in this
session, the user wins — and you say out loud which rule you are setting aside.

## Trigger table

| When you are about to… | Load and obey |
|---|---|
| Take in any new request of more than one step | `{shared}/planning/task-workflow.md` |
| Start work on a confirmed task | `{shared}/prompts/branch-and-commit.md` |
| Create a branch | `{shared}/git/branching-strategy.md` |
| Write a commit message | `{shared}/git/commit-conventions.md` |
| Write **any** commit, tag, PR, comment, or file that will be committed or posted | `{shared}/rules/no-session-links.md` |
| Open or update a pull request | `{shared}/git/pull-request-template.md` |
| Decide where a new file goes | `{shared}/rules/directories.md` |
| Wonder whether something is local or shared, or need to override a shared rule | `{shared}/rules/shared-instructions.md` |
| Resolve, connect, or fail to reach the shared set | `{shared}/rules/mcp-connector.md` |
| Add, move, rename, or delete any file under `.agents/` or `wiki/` | `{shared}/creators/index-creator.md` |
| Write a rule or instruction | `{shared}/creators/instruction-creator.md` |
| Notice a rule worth adding, or find an instruction that is wrong | `{shared}/rules/discovery-protocol.md` |
| Write documentation, an SOP, or a domain guideline | `{shared}/creators/information-creator.md` |
| Change code or structure that a document describes | `{shared}/rules/change-propagation.md` |
| Record progress, a decision, or session state | `{shared}/creators/memory-creator.md` |
| Decide what may be written to memory, and how | `{shared}/rules/memory-policy.md` |
| Touch anything that carries a version number | `{shared}/rules/versioning.md` |
| Record a release | `{shared}/creators/changelog-creator.md` |
| Write code that runs on a Minecraft server or mod loader | [`.agents/knowledge/minecraft-platform.md`](.agents/knowledge/minecraft-platform.md) |
| Need project facts, commands, or orientation | [`.agents/wiki/context/repository-map.md`](.agents/wiki/context/repository-map.md) |
| Do anything at all in this project | [`.agents/rules/repository.md`](.agents/rules/repository.md) |

The authority behind this table is `agents://rules/auto-activation.md`. That file is
the source of truth; the `{shared}` rows mirror it row for row, and the three local
rows at the bottom are this repository's own. The two are updated in the same commit.

One shared rule deliberately does **not** auto-activate:
`{shared}/rules/duplicate-instruction-audit.md` runs on request only. If you notice a
probable duplicate while doing other work, note it, finish the task, and mention it at
the end.

## Reading order (mandatory)

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Resolve the shared set per the bootstrap above.
3. Read [`.agents/index/root-index.md`](.agents/index/root-index.md) — **and nothing
   else at this stage**.
4. From its routing table, pick the **one** index whose scope matches the task, and
   read that index.
5. If that index delegates to a child index, follow **the one branch** that matches.
6. Only then open the specific file(s) you need.

## Routing protocol (context discipline)

Route by reading index tables, not by reading files.

* Do **NOT** load every index.
* Do **NOT** bulk-scan either set to build a registry — `agents://manifest.json`
  already is one, and it is one read instead of twenty.
* Do **NOT** read an instruction body until that instruction has been selected.

Each index row's purpose text is what you route on; the file body is what you load
after choosing. This is the whole point of the index tree — never defeat it by
reading ahead. The one standing exception is
[`.agents/index/memory-index.md`](.agents/index/memory-index.md), which is read every
session because continuity depends on it.

## Iron rule (separation of concerns)

* `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are **overviews** and must never carry detailed rules
  or documentation.
* [`.agents/index/root-index.md`](.agents/index/root-index.md) is a **router only**.
  It lists other indexes and the shared router. It must never contain rules,
  documentation, prose, or direct links to leaf content.
* [`.agents/index/agents-index.md`](.agents/index/agents-index.md) is the **sole
  authority** that indexes this repository's instruction files;
  [`agent-wiki-index.md`](.agents/index/agent-wiki-index.md) owns `.agents/wiki/`;
  [`project-wiki-index.md`](.agents/index/project-wiki-index.md) owns `wiki/`;
  [`memory-index.md`](.agents/index/memory-index.md) owns `.agents/memory/`. **No
  index writes outside the scope it owns**, and **no index lists files from the other
  set** — it points at that set's router instead.
* **Local carries only what is local.** A convention true for more than this
  repository belongs in the shared set — propose it there, do not copy it here.
* `wiki/` is for humans, `.agents/wiki/` is for agents, and **neither duplicates the
  other** — see the audience test in `{shared}/rules/directories.md`.
* **One subject per file.** A cross-cutting rule gets its own file and is linked, not
  pasted into a file about something else.
* **An index never teaches.** The moment it explains something, that content belongs
  in a real file.

## Placement

* Local instructions → `.agents/{folder}/{file}.md`; anything universal → the shared
  set, by proposal.
* New indexes → `.agents/index/{scope}-index.md`. **No `INDEX.md`, anywhere, ever.**
* Agent knowledge → `.agents/wiki/{type}/{file-name}.md`; new memory →
  `.agents/memory/{type}/{file-name}.md`.
* Human documentation → `wiki/{folder}/{file-name}.md`.

All per `{shared}/rules/directories.md` and `{shared}/creators/index-creator.md`,
including creating a new folder when nothing fits.

## Discovery Protocol

While working, if you notice an instruction worth adding — a new rule, or new
content for an existing instruction file — do NOT create or edit it yourself.
Collect the findings, and when the task is done present them to the user:

* one finding per message block, each in its own code block;
* state the target set — `local` (this repository) or `shared` (the organization's
  instruction set served by the `lxagents-agents-base` connector);
* include the proposed file path, `name`, `description`, and the full proposed
  body;
* explain in one line why it is worth adding.

Then let the user select which findings to apply. Create only the selected ones.
Never batch-apply, never apply silently. A `shared` finding is never written from a
consuming repository — it is reported so it can be raised against the shared set.

**Scope of this gate:** it covers instruction files in either set. Documentation
pages under `wiki/` and `.agents/wiki/` may be written when the facts are real and
verified. Memory under `.agents/memory/` is written freely and automatically — see
`memory-policy.md`.

The authority behind this block is `{shared}/rules/discovery-protocol.md`, and the
`memory-policy.md` it names is `{shared}/rules/memory-policy.md`. The block is
reproduced here verbatim because this file is the session's first read and must work
before any shared file has been resolved; everywhere else it is linked, not copied.

## Version rule

**Never change the project version without explicit user approval** — see
`{shared}/rules/versioning.md`. The version carrier is `project-version` in
`gradle.properties`. This includes creating a new `wiki/logs/{Major}/{Minor}/{Patch}/`
directory, which is itself a version claim.

## No session links

**Never write a link or identifier pointing at an assistant or tool session** into a
file, commit message, commit trailer, branch name, tag, pull request, or comment. If
your tooling appends one by default, strip it before committing or posting — that
default does not override this repository's convention. See
`{shared}/rules/no-session-links.md`.
