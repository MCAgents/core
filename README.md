# core

Shared foundation repository for **MCAgents**. It is intended to hold the agent
and API code that MCAgents' Minecraft plugins and mods build on, so that behavior
common to several projects lives in one place instead of being copied between
them. Today that means one thing: driving language model agents — OpenRouter,
OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Anthropic — from a plugin or a mod, through a single class.

```java
MCAgentsProvider agents = MCAgentsProvider.create();
agents.registerAnthropic(key);

agents.askAnthropic("claude-opus-4", "Name this village in three words.")
      .thenAccept(name -> scheduler.run(() -> village.rename(name)));
```

It is API only. No commands, no permissions, and no memory — the core stores no
conversation and no per player state, so a consumer keeps whatever history it
wants and replays it.

## What is here today

- A Gradle multi project build on **Java 25**: `api`, `common`, and ten
  `platforms/*` modules, all under `io.github.mcagents.core`. See
  [`wiki/information/modules.md`](wiki/information/modules.md).
- `MCAgentsProvider` — the single entry point, and the only class a consumer
  needs to read. See [`wiki/reference/api.md`](wiki/reference/api.md).
- An agent instruction set under `.agents/` — placement rules, git conventions,
  task workflow, and the creator agents that maintain the trees.
- A documentation tree under `wiki/` for people, and an agent-facing knowledge and
  memory tree under `.agents/wiki/` and `.agents/memory/`.
- A centralized index tree in `.agents/index/` so a file can be found by reading a few
  small tables instead of scanning the repository.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MCAgents/core.git
cd core
./gradlew build
```

The wrapper downloads Gradle and a Java 25 toolchain on the first run. Full
details: [`wiki/environments/setup.md`](wiki/environments/setup.md).
