/**
 * The credentials configured for one vendor, and which of them is in use.
 *
 * <p>A pool starts at the first credential and stays there. It moves on only
 * when a request fails, and what it does then depends entirely on why:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Rejected</strong> — the credential is dead. {@link #reject()}
 *       drops it from the pool <em>and from storage</em>, so a key that will
 *       never work again is not retried on every request forever.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Rate limited</strong> — the credential is fine and came too
 *       fast. {@link #rotate()} moves to the next one and <em>keeps</em> this
 *       one. Evicting here would destroy something the user paid for, and
 *       nothing inside the game can undo that.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When the last credential is rejected the pool reports
 * {@link TokenState#EXPIRED} rather than {@link TokenState#NOT_SET}, so the
 * message a server owner sees tells them their keys stopped working rather than
 * that they forgot to add one.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every method is synchronized. Rotation happens on whichever thread a
 * failed request completed on, which on Folia can be any region thread, and the
 * operations are compound — read the current credential, drop it, advance —
 * so an atomic field would look safe without being so.</p>
