 * last four characters. That is enough for an administrator to tell their keys
 * apart and enough for tab completion to be useful, while the value itself never
 * leaves the file.</p>
 *
 * <p>The alternative — completing on the tokens themselves — would push live API
 * keys into every client's suggestion list, where they show up on a stream, a
 * screenshot, or a shared screen. A key is worth money, so the convenience is
 * not worth it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Four characters is the same disclosure a payment card gets, and is far too
 * little to reconstruct a key from.</p>
