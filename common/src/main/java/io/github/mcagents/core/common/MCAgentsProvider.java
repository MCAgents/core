/**
 * The single entry point to the MCAgents core.
 *
 * <p>This is the only class a consumer needs to read. Everything the core can
 * do is a method here, and everything behind it — the HTTP transport, the four
 * vendor dialects, the client registry — is package-private and unreachable
 * from outside. There is no second way in.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Getting one</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * MCAgentsProvider agents = MCAgentsProvider.create();
 * agents.registerOpenRouter(config.getString("openrouter.key"));
 * agents.registerAnthropic(config.getString("anthropic.key"));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Or, for a single vendor, {@link #openRouter(String)},
 * {@link #openAi(String)}, {@link #deepSeek(String)}, and
 * {@link #anthropic(String)} build a provider with that vendor already
 * registered.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Asking something</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * agents.askAnthropic("claude-opus-4", "Name this village in three words.")
 *       .thenAccept(reply -> scheduler.run(() -> villager.setName(reply)))
 *       .exceptionally(failure -> { logger.warning(failure.getMessage()); return null; });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Two rules worth knowing before you build on this</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing is remembered.</strong> The provider holds no conversation,
 * no cache, and no per player state — the registered vendors are the whole of
 * its memory. A caller that wants a multi turn conversation keeps the history
 * itself and replays it, which is what {@link ChatResponse#asMessage()} is
 * for. This is deliberate: a shared core that quietly accumulated per player
 * history would leak memory in every plugin that used it.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing blocks.</strong> Every remote call returns a
 * {@link CompletableFuture} and does its work off the calling thread, so a call
 * is safe from a tick — but the completion is not. Nothing guarantees which
 * thread a future finishes on, so a callback that touches the world, an entity,
 * or an inventory must hop back onto the right scheduler first. On Folia that
 * means the scheduler owning the region, not a global one.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Failure</h2>
 *
 * <p>Failures arrive as a failed future whose cause is always an
 * {@link AgentException} — carrying the vendor, the HTTP status when there was
 * one, and helpers such as {@link AgentException#isRateLimited()}. Only
 * argument validation throws directly, because that is a programming error
 * rather than a remote failure.</p>
