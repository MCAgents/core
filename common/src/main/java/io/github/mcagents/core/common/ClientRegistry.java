 * are not just reads and writes: registering has to close whatever it replaced,
 * and closing has to close every client exactly once. Those are compound
 * actions, and a concurrent map would make them look safe without making them
 * so. Contention is a non issue — registration happens at startup, and lookups
 * are a map read.</p>
