/**
 * Who is asking, as the <strong>server</strong> knows them.
 *
 * <p>Every field here must be read from server-side state — the player the
 * server has authenticated, and the permission level the server assigned. None
 * of it may come from a packet. A client can claim any name and any level it
 * likes; believing the claim is the whole class of bug this record exists to
 * make visible, because a reviewer can see at the construction site where each
 * value came from.</p>
 *
 * @param uniqueId The player's identity, or {@code null} for the server console
 *                 — which has no player behind it and is trusted absolutely,
 *                 since whoever reached it already owns the machine.
 * @param name What to call them in a message. Never blank; a blank name is a
 *             caller that was never really identified.
 * @param permissionLevel The level the server assigned, on Minecraft's own
 *                        0 to 4 scale. A negative value is clamped to
 *                        {@code 0} rather than rejected — a malformed level
 *                        must fail closed, never open.
