/**
 * Where a dedicated server keeps its credential file.
 *
 * <p>Not where a client keeps one, and the difference matters. On a client the
 * file is shared: one {@code mcagents.json} under the player's Minecraft
 * directory, found by every MCAgents mod they install, holding the keys they
 * pay for. A server has no business reading that — it is a different machine,
 * a different owner, and a different bill. So the server's file lives under the
 * server's own run directory, in {@value #CONFIG_FOLDER}, which is where both
 * loaders already put mod configuration.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The fallback is the working directory, not the home directory</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link MinecraftDirectory} falls back to {@code ~/.minecraft} when a
 * loader reports nothing, which is right on a client and wrong here: a server
 * is started from its own folder, and the account running it may not have a
 * Minecraft directory at all. Falling back to the process working directory
 * puts the file beside the server jar, which is where an owner looks.</p>
