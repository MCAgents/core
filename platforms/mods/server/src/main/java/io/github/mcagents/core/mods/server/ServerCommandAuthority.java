/**
 * Decides whether a caller may do something to the server's credentials.
 *
 * <p>This is the truth check, and it belongs on the server for one reason: a
 * client cannot be believed. On a client, "am I allowed?" is a question with no
 * adversary — the player owns the machine and the keys. On a server the same
 * question is the only thing standing between a player and the owner's billing
 * account, and any part of the answer that a client could influence is not an
 * answer at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>So the input is a {@link CommandCaller} built from server-side state, and
 * the rules here are deliberately dull: one required level, applied to every
 * action, with no exceptions and no per-action softening. Rules that are easy
 * to state are rules that are easy to audit.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Refusals are values, not exceptions</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #refusalFor(CommandCaller, ServerAction)} returns the reason as an
 * {@link Optional}, because being refused is an ordinary outcome that a command
 * shows the player, not an error with a stack trace. Callers that would rather
 * fail loudly use {@link #require(CommandCaller, ServerAction)}.</p>
