/**
 * The server half's entry point.
 *
 * <p>Two things differ from the client half, and both are the reason the halves
 * are separate rather than one class with a branch in it:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>The credentials belong to the server owner</strong>, so they
 *       live under the server's run directory rather than under a player's
 *       Minecraft directory. See {@link ServerRunDirectory}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Every operation is checked.</strong> A client has one user who
 *       already owns the keys; a server has as many users as it has players,
 *       and none of them owns the bill. See
 *       {@link ServerCommandAuthority}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>No side guard is asserted in the constructor. Server logic runs on a
 * client too — a single player world is a server — and refusing to construct
 * this there would break single player for nothing. What must not happen is the
 * reverse, and that is guarded on the client half.</p>
