/**
 * Which physical side this process is, resolved once and answered cheaply.
 *
 * <p>Three sources, most authoritative first:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>What the loader said.</strong> A loader knows its own
 *       distribution and is told before it loads a single mod class.
 *       {@link #install(PhysicalSide)} is how a loader entry point passes that
 *       on, and it is always right.</li>
 *   <li><strong>The {@value #SIDE_PROPERTY} system property.</strong> The
 *       escape hatch, and what a test uses when it is not exercising
 *       {@link #install(PhysicalSide)} itself.</li>
 *   <li><strong>A classpath probe.</strong> {@value #CLIENT_MARKER_CLASS} is
 *       present in a client distribution and absent from a dedicated server
 *       one, which is exactly the difference this class exists to detect.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The probe is last on purpose. It is a guess about someone else's jar, and
 * a guess that is wrong in the safe direction — an unrecognised classpath reads
 * as a dedicated server, so the client half is not started somewhere it cannot
 * run.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 *
 * <p>The resolved side is held in a {@code volatile} field and never changes
 * after a loader installs it, so any thread may ask at any time.</p>
