 * <p>There is no fixed path. It differs by operating system, and launchers and
 * modpacks relocate it constantly — MultiMC, Prism, and the modern Mojang
 * launcher all give an instance its own directory. Hardcoding
 * {@code ~/.minecraft} would work for one user in three and silently write the
 * file somewhere nobody looks for the rest.</p>
 *
 * <p>Resolution runs in order, most explicit first:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The {@code MCAGENTS_DIR} environment variable, when set. The escape
 *       hatch for anyone whose setup this class guesses wrong.</li>
 *   <li>The directory the loader supplied, when a mod passed one. A loader
 *       knows where its own instance lives, and it is right where guessing is
 *       not.</li>
 *   <li>The operating system's conventional location.</li>
