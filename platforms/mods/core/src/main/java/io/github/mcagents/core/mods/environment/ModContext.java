 *
 * @param side The physical side this process is. Comes from the loader rather
 *             than from {@link ModEnvironment} so the value the entry point
 *             acts on is the same one the bootstrap dispatched on.
 * @param gameDirectory The directory the loader reported, or {@code null} when
 *                      it reported none. Never resolved here — what it means
 *                      differs by side, and each half resolves it its own way.
 * @param logger Where to report problems.
 * @param requestTimeout How long one model request may take before it is
 *                       abandoned.
