/**
 * The check each side-bound entry point makes about where it is running.
 *
 * <p>One line at the top of a constructor, and a wiring mistake becomes a
 * {@link WrongSideException} naming the feature and both sides, instead of a
 * {@code NoClassDefFoundError} some frames later naming a Minecraft class.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is a diagnostic, not a security boundary. What actually keeps the
 * client half off a dedicated server is that nothing links it by type — see
 * {@link ModBootstrap}, which resolves an entry point by name for the detected
 * side and never mentions the other one.</p>
 *
 * <p>The two checks are not symmetric, and that is deliberate.
 * {@link #requireClient(String)} is the one that matters: client classes are
 * genuinely absent from a dedicated server.
 * {@link #requireDedicatedServer(String)} is narrower and rarer — most server
 * logic is perfectly at home inside a client hosting a single player world, so
 * guarding it as dedicated-server-only would break single player for nothing.
 * Reach for it only when something must not run in a client process at all.</p>
