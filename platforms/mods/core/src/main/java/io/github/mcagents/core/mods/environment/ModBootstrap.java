/**
 * Starts exactly one physical side, and never links the other.
 *
 * <p>This class is the whole reason a single universal jar can carry both
 * halves. It names each entry point as a <strong>string</strong>, not as a
 * type, and resolves only the one matching the side actually running. A
 * dedicated server therefore never loads, links, or verifies a client class —
 * not because the class was stripped from the jar, but because nothing ever
 * asked for it.</p>
 *
 * <p>That is also why neither {@code platforms:mods:client} nor
 * {@code platforms:mods:server} appears in this module's dependencies. If it
 * did, the compiler would happily let someone write
 * {@code new ClientEntrypoint()} here, and the property above would quietly
 * stop being true.</p>
