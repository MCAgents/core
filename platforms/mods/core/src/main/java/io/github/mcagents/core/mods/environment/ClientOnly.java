/**
 * Marks something that exists on a client and nowhere else.
 *
 * <p>This is the loader-neutral spelling of Fabric's {@code @Environment(CLIENT)}
 * and NeoForge's {@code @OnlyIn(Dist.CLIENT)}. Neither of those can be used
 * here: resolving them needs a loader toolchain that remaps Minecraft, and the
 * mod family deliberately compiles without one so it stays plain Java and stays
 * testable. When a loader module gains that toolchain, this annotation is what
 * it maps to the loader's own.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>The annotation is documentation, not enforcement.</strong> What
 * actually keeps client code off a dedicated server is the module layout —
 * {@code platforms:mods:client} is never named by type from anywhere — and the
 * {@link SideGuard} check at each entry point. Marking a class does not make it
 * safe; putting it in the client module and never linking it does.</p>
 *
 * <p>Retained at runtime so a test can assert that the client half is marked,
 * which is the cheapest way to keep the convention from rotting.</p>
