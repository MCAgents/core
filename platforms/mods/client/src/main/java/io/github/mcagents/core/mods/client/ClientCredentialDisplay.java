/**
 * Turns credential status lines into something a client chat box can show.
 *
 * <p>Local rendering, and nothing else: no state, no I/O, no game types. It
 * takes the lines the shared command layer produced and wraps them to a width,
 * because a client chat box truncates rather than wraps and a status line that
 * runs off the right edge is a status line nobody read.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why this is client-only</h2>
 *
 * <p>A dedicated server writes to a console, which wraps on its own and is far
 * wider than any chat box. Wrapping there would mangle output that was fine.
 * The difference is small, and that is the point — a small difference between
 * the sides still belongs on one side, not behind a branch inside shared
 * code.</p>
 *
 * <h2>What it must never do</h2>
 *
 * <p>Reveal a credential. The lines arriving here already carry masked handles
 * rather than tokens; this class only ever splits and indents them, so there is
 * no path by which a token could appear. Do not add one.</p>
