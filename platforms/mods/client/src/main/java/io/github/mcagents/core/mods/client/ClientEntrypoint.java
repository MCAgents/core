/**
 * The client half's entry point.
 *
 * <p>On a client the credentials are the <em>player's own</em>. They live in the
 * shared {@code mcagents.json} under the Minecraft directory, where every
 * MCAgents mod the player installs finds the same file, and they are managed
 * from the player's own commands. None of that is true on a dedicated server,
 * which is the whole reason this half exists separately —
 * {@code io.github.mcagents.core.mods.server.ServerEntrypoint} is the
 * counterpart, and is deliberately not on this module's classpath.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <p>A loader constructs this reflectively through
 * {@link io.github.mcagents.core.mods.environment.ModBootstrap} and calls
 * {@link #start(ModContext)} once. Constructing it on a dedicated server throws
 * immediately rather than failing later somewhere less legible.</p>
