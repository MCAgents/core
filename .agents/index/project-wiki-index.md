# Project Wiki Index

**Scope:** `wiki/` (except `logs/`)
**Parent:** [root-index](root-index.md)

This index owns `wiki/` and only `wiki/`. It never writes into `.agents/`. Any page
added to or removed from `wiki/` is reflected here **in the same commit**.

Pages here are **plain markdown with no frontmatter**, written for a person who has
never seen the repository. Knowledge written for agents belongs to
[`agent-wiki-index.md`](agent-wiki-index.md) instead.

## Information

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`../../wiki/information/overview.md`](../../wiki/information/overview.md) | What this repository is, what it is for, and what it contains today. |
| [`../../wiki/information/modules.md`](../../wiki/information/modules.md) | The twelve build modules, how they depend on each other, and what is published. |
| [`../../wiki/information/mod-sides.md`](../../wiki/information/mod-sides.md) | How the mod half runs on a client and a dedicated server from one jar, without either side loading the other's code. |

## Guides

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`../../wiki/guides/llm-providers.md`](../../wiki/guides/llm-providers.md) | Getting from an API key to a model's reply, and the threading and memory rules that come with it. |

## Reference

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`../../wiki/reference/api.md`](../../wiki/reference/api.md) | Every public type in the api and common modules, method by method. |

## Environments

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`../../wiki/environments/setup.md`](../../wiki/environments/setup.md) | Getting a local working copy, and building, testing, and publishing it. |

## Child Indexes

| Index | Scope | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| [`logs-index.md`](logs-index.md) | `wiki/logs/` versioned change logs | You need release history, or must record a change against a version. |
