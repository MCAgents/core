# Logs Index

**Scope:** `wiki/logs/`
**Parent:** [project-wiki-index](project-wiki-index.md)

Every version directory is `wiki/logs/{Major}/{Minor}/{Patch}/`, numeric segments
only — no `v` prefix, no zero padding. A version directory holds `CHANGELOG.md` by
default, and may hold `MIGRATION.md`, `BREAKING.md`, `UPGRADE.md`, or `NOTES.md`
beside it.

**Creating a new version directory is a version claim** and requires user approval —
see `.agents/rules/versioning.md`.
