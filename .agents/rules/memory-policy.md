# Memory Policy

## Memory is written automatically and needs no approval

This is the deliberate exception to the Discovery Protocol. Instructions are gated;
**memory is not.** Do not ask before writing memory, and do not defer it to the end
of a branch.

**An agent that finishes a meaningful unit of work and writes nothing to memory has
failed the task.** Memory that waits for permission is memory that never gets
written, and a session that starts with no memory restarts work instead of continuing
it.

## What to write, and where

Every memory file is `.agents/memory/{type}/{file-name}.md`.

| You have | Write it to | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| Ongoing or completed work | `tasks/{slug}.md` | Goal, plan, status, branches, pull requests. One file per task. |
| What happened in a working session | `sessions/{yyyy-mm-dd}-{slug}.md` | What was done, what was learned, what was left. |
| A choice with consequences | `decisions/{slug}.md` | Context, options considered, the choice, the consequence. |
| The current live state of an area | `state/{area}.md` | Overwritten in place, always current — never an append-only log. |

Pick the `{type}` that matches, and **extend an existing file on the same subject
rather than creating a near-duplicate** — check
[`../index/memory-index.md`](../index/memory-index.md) first.

## When to write, without being asked

* At the end of a task.
* When a decision is made that a future session would otherwise re-litigate.
* When work is left unfinished — say exactly where it stopped and what is next.
* When something surprising is learned about the codebase.
* When a branch or a pull request is opened.

## Never write to memory

* Secrets, API tokens, credentials, private keys.
* Customer data or personal data.
* Full file dumps, or pasted source that already lives in the repository.
* Anything you would not put in a public commit.

**Memory is committed to git like everything else.** It is not a private scratchpad,
and there is no such thing as deleting it after the fact. In this repository that
matters twice over: `core` handles provider credentials, so a token that reaches a
memory file is a leaked token — see
[`../knowledge/minecraft-platform.md`](../knowledge/minecraft-platform.md) for what
the project holds and where.

## Memory is never normative

A memory file may say **"we currently do X"**. It may never say **"always do X"**.

Recording state is the job; asserting a rule is not. A rule that deserves to be
permanent is proposed as an instruction through the Discovery Protocol below, and
lands under `.agents/{folder}/` — never as a memory entry that a later agent mistakes
for policy. Precedence is settled in
[`auto-activation.md`](auto-activation.md): an instruction always beats a memory
file.

## Entry format

Every memory file has:

1. Frontmatter — `name: memory-{type}-{topic}`, and a one-line `description`.
2. One `#` H1 title.
3. Dated entries, **newest first**, under `## {YYYY-MM-DD}` headings.

Inside an entry, state facts: file paths, branch names, pull request numbers, commit
subjects, commands that ran and what they returned. **No speculation presented as
fact** — if something is a guess, label it a guess.

## Staleness

Before trusting a memory file, check its newest entry date against the repository's
current state.

**If they disagree, the repository wins.** Correct the memory file in the same commit
as your work — a memory file describing a state that no longer exists is worse than
no memory at all, because the next agent will act on it.

## Retention

* When a task ships, mark its `tasks/` file `status: done` and add a closing entry.
* At each release, fold the `sessions/` files belonging to that release into **one
  digest** inside the release's `wiki/logs/{Major}/{Minor}/{Patch}/` directory, then
  delete the originals and their rows in
  [`../index/memory-index.md`](../index/memory-index.md). That fold is the
  [`../creators/changelog-creator.md`](../creators/changelog-creator.md)'s job.
* `decisions/` files are permanent. Do not prune them.
* `state/` files are overwritten in place and never accumulate history.

## Registration

**Every memory file appears in [`../index/memory-index.md`](../index/memory-index.md)
in the same commit that creates it.** An unregistered memory file will not be read,
which makes it worthless.

## Discovery Protocol

While working, if you notice an instruction worth adding — a new rule, or new
content for an existing instruction file — do NOT create or edit it yourself.
Collect the findings, and when the task is done present them to the user:

* one finding per message block, each in its own code block;
* include the proposed file path, `name`, `description`, and the full proposed
  body;
* explain in one line why it is worth adding.

Then let the user select which findings to apply. Create only the selected ones.
Never batch-apply, never apply silently.

**Scope of this gate:** it covers instruction files under `.agents/{folder}/`.
Documentation pages under `wiki/` and `.agents/wiki/` may be written when the facts
are real and verified. Memory under `.agents/memory/` is written freely and
automatically — which is what this file governs.
