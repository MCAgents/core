/**
 * What every failure reaching a language model arrives as.
 *
 * <p>One exception type covers the lot — a rejected key, a rate limit, a
 * malformed response, an unreachable host — because a caller on a Minecraft
 * server almost always handles them the same way: log it and move on. What
 * distinguishes them is {@link #statusCode()}, which carries the HTTP status
 * when the failure came back from the vendor.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is unchecked deliberately. These failures surface as a failed
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture} rather than as something thrown
 * at a call site, and a checked type would force a {@code catch} on code that
 * never sees one.</p>
