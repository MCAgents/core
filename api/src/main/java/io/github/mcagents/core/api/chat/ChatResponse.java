/**
 * What a language model returned for one {@link ChatRequest}.
 *
 * <p>Only the first choice is carried. Every supported vendor can return
 * several candidate completions, but the core does not ask for more than one,
 * so a response maps to exactly one reply.</p>
 *
 * @param id The vendor's identifier for this exchange, or an empty string when
 *           the vendor returned none. Useful for correlating with a vendor
 *           dashboard, and for nothing else.
 * @param model The model that actually answered. This can differ from the model
 *              that was requested — OpenRouter in particular routes to whatever
 *              provider is serving, and reports what it picked here.
 * @param content The reply text, never {@code null}. Empty when the model
 *                produced no text, which happens when generation was cut off
 *                immediately.
 * @param finishReason Why generation stopped, as the vendor worded it — for
 *                     example {@code "stop"}, {@code "length"}, or
 *                     {@code "content_filter"}. Empty when none was reported.
 *                     Deliberately not an enum: the vocabulary differs per
 *                     vendor and grows without notice.
 * @param usage What the exchange cost, or {@link TokenUsage#UNKNOWN} when the
 *              vendor reported nothing.
