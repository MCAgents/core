/**
 * Everything the core can do, in one contract.
 *
 * <p>A provider holds one client per registered {@link LlmVendor} and routes
 * each call to the right one, so a consumer talks to OpenRouter, OpenAI,
 * DeepSeek, and Anthropic through a single object rather than juggling four.
 * The implementation is
 * {@code io.github.mcagents.core.common.MCAgentsProvider}, which is the only
 * class a consumer needs to read.</p>
 *
 * <h2>No memory</h2>
 *
 * <p>A provider stores no conversation, no cache, and no per player state. The
 * only thing it holds is the set of registered vendors. Anything resembling
 * history is the caller's to keep and to replay — see
 * {@link ChatResponse#asMessage()}.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every remote call returns a {@link CompletableFuture} and does its work off
 * the calling thread, so none of them may be assumed to complete on the thread
 * that started them. Registration and lookup are safe to call from any thread
 * or Folia region.</p>
