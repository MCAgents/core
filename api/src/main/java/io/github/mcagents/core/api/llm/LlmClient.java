/**
 * The conversation with one vendor.
 *
 * <p>A client is bound to a single {@link LlmVendor} and one set of
 * {@link LlmCredentials} for its whole life. It holds no conversation state: a
 * {@link ChatRequest} carries everything the vendor needs, and nothing about it
 * is remembered afterwards.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every method returns immediately with a {@link CompletableFuture} and
 * performs its work off the calling thread. That is not a convenience — a
 * Minecraft server tick must never block on a network call, and on Folia there
 * is no single main thread to block in the first place. Implementations are
 * safe to call from any thread or region.</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing guarantees which thread a returned future completes on, so a
 * callback that touches game state must hop back onto the right scheduler
 * itself.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Failure</h2>
 *
 * <p>Failures arrive as a failed future, never as a thrown exception, and the
 * cause is always an
 * {@link io.github.mcagents.core.api.AgentException}. Argument validation is
 * the exception to that rule: a {@code null} or malformed argument throws
 * immediately, because it is a programming error rather than a remote
 * failure.</p>
